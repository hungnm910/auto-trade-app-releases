# Mimin-Vue Firebase Auth

Attention! I am still developing it and there are still bugs

## Project Description

Front-end project of back-end management system based on Vue+Vuetify. A general business component template and dynamic routing are extracted, which can be used for rapid development in cooperation with the background.

### Technology Stack

**Front-end technology stack**: Vue2.x + vuex + vue-router + webpack + ES6 + vuetify

**Back-end technology stack**: NodeJS + NestJS + Firebase Auth

## Run the project

Because this project does not use mock, you also need to clone the back-end project.

``` sh
git clone

npm install

npm run serve
```

### Common components and business components

* Firebase Auth
* User Management

In addition to the related functions listed above, some common business components are also encapsulated, such as:

* General form components (the form can be rendered according to the interface data, such as button control, check control, etc.)
* General tree component (same as above)
* Data self
* rendering form (the form can be automatically rendered according to the data type)
* Image upload and cropping component

Based on this front-end and back-end, a relatively simple store management project was also implemented.
